# WIP: Kijutsu 記述

Amine stats for user provided by [Kitsu](https://kitsu.io)

記述 means descriptor (Google translate said, sorry)

## Install

Install globally with `npm install -g kijutsu`

## Usage

You only need to provide your username, ex: `kijutsu necroface`. It should return something like...

```
_  ___  _       _

## HELP WANTED!!!

Any suggestion or pull request will be welcome. This app is slow as shit because request library entries every single run.

### Thanks
- To @wopian for hibari
- To [kitsu](https://kitsu.io)


BTW... I built this because I like to see how much time I spent ~~waste~~ watching anime, if you too give it a :star:
